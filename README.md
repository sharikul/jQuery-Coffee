# jQuery-Coffee

jQuery-Coffee is a project that aims to completely rewrite the jQuery source in CoffeeScript. Each .coffee file corresponds to a jQuery .js file somewhere in the project.

## It's all hand written
Whilst it's easy to believe that some online converter has been used to translate JavaScript code to CoffeeScript code, I can assure you that the conversions have been written by hand. If my original intention was to just copy over code, I wouldn't have started this repository.
